Solution

The simplest approach is to use a NAT. Here are the steps:

As root in the host, create and setup your tap0 device (192.168.100.0 will be our NAT network, and felipec our user):

# tunctl -u lofyer -t tap0
# ifconfig tap0 192.168.100.1 up

# qemu-kvm -hda winxp.cow -m 512 -net nic -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no

In your guest:
ip addr: 192.168.100.2
gateway: 192.168.100.1
dns: 8.8.8.8


NAT

As root in the host:

# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
# iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i tap0 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -I FORWARD 1 -o tap0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

Now you should be able to use ping back-and-forth between the guest and the host, and both should be able to access the Internet
